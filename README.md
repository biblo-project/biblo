# Biblo
Reading tracker and book recommendation Android application

## Concept notes

### Recommended Architecture (Initial, small scale)
```
Flutter App <=> Monolith Backend API Server <=> Database
```
No need for proxy yet since at this stage we're not creating microservices

In the backend, there are logically separate features — physically in one service.

### Functionalities 
1. User sign-up/login 
2. Get random suggestions (nothing to do with ML) 
3. Get curated suggestions (using ML) 
4. Update preferences (for the ML component to use for generating suggestions) 
5. Play a game 

     a. Fill-In-The-Blanks 
     b. Identify-the-book-from-the-dialogue 
     c. Match-the-authors-with-the-books  

### Domains
1. Auth Domain
2. Recommendation Domain
3. Game Domain

### Database design

1. Users
```
id (UUID)
username
email
password_hash
created_at
```
2. Books
```
id
title
author
genre
theme
trope
era
setting
pub_year
```
3. Quotes
```
id
book_id (foreign key)
quote_text
difficulty_level
```
4. Games
```
id
user_id
score
started_at
ended_at
```

### Games:
* Tic-Tac-Toe
* Rock-Paper-Scissors
* Coin-Toss
* Quiz game teaching the user about women in literature
* Card game
  1. There are two players that play against each other: the user and Biblo
  2. Both the players have a counter measuring their health in a number. The counter changes colours to depict the current health of the player. It's colours are: <br/>

     a. Green if the player's health is above a certain threshold, indicating that it is good <br/>
     b. Yellow if the player's health is within a certain range, indicating that it is low <br/>
     c. Red if the player's health is below a certain threshold, indicating that it's poor and the player could lose soon <br/>

  3. The game or "battle" is timed with a timer on screen.
  4. The user has a stack of cards from which they'll select one. On the screen you'll see two boxes, one displaying the current card and the other displaying the stack with just "stack" displayed on top of it.
  5. The can see what cards they have in a pop with left and right moving buttons to show them their collection of cards, and they can select one of them to play next.
  6. Biblo's card selection will be random.
  7. Both the user's and Biblo's card selection will be randomly decided. While the user can select the next card to play, Biblo will randomly select a card from its randomly selected collection.
  8. The cards are about popular mythical characters like vampires, werewolves, elves, dragons, pegasuses, goblins, etc. with different stats.
  9. There are 3 group of cards: <br/>
  
     a. "Common": Normal stats, not too high, not too low <br/>
     b. "Rare": Underpowered characters, low stats <br/>
     c. "Legendary": Overpowered characters, high stats <br/>

    NOTE: All the characters stats are balanced <br/>
 10. The stats of both the players get balanced out based on differences between their different stats.
 11. If a player has legendary cards, against the other player's non-legendary cards, then their health will increase by a small number (apart from the balancing out between their respective stats)
 12. If a player has  a rare card, against the other player's non-rare cards, their health will decrease by a small number (apart from the balancing out between their respective stats) 
 13. Common cards have no special effects similar to the legendary and rare cards

## Biblo — Kafka & OpenSearch Integration Plan
### Overview
* PostgreSQL remains the primary database and source of truth.
* Kafka and OpenSearch are additions that enhance performance and intelligence — they do not replace PostgreSQL.

### 1. Apache Kafka
**Role:** Message broker that captures user activity as real-time events.
**Where it fits:**

* Every meaningful user action generates a Kafka event
* These events continuously feed the ML recommendation engine with live user behaviour data

**Events to track:**
```
user_viewed_book
user_played_game
user_updated_preferences
user_saved_book
```
**When to add:** After the curated (ML-based) recommendations are working.

### 2. OpenSearch
**Role:** Powers fast book search and recommendation display.
**Where it fits:**

* Handles book search queries instead of querying PostgreSQL directly (faster at scale)
* Supports fuzzy search — typos still return correct results
* Can power the curated recommendations display layer

**When to add:** After book search is working with PostgreSQL.

### How the full stack connects
User action (Flutter)
→ FastAPI
→ Kafka (logs the event)
→ ML module (reads Kafka events, updates recommendations)
→ OpenSearch (indexes and serves results)
→ Flutter displays results

### Technology summary

**PostgreSQL** — permanent data storage (users, books, preferences, game scores)
**OpenSearch** — fast search and retrieval layer on top of PostgreSQL data
**Kafka** — real-time event streaming layer feeding the ML module
